##  Description

This webpage is my first attempt at my portfolio. This is my first attempt at using bootstrap to make a successful, responsive, webpage. The navigation bar at the top is interactive and will guide you to one of 3 pages:

       1.Contact Me
       2.Portfolio
       3.About Me



## Future Plans
I plan to make this more personalized as well as adding my future projects into 'portfolio'. Since this is my first attempt, the colors will change in the future as well as abilities of the webpage by incrementing features I learn in the future.

I hope to use this one day for future employers to see my abilities, as well as, sample my future projects.
